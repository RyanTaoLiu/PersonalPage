This paper introduces a novel curve-based slicing method for generating planar layers with dynamically varying orientations in digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. Our approach effectively addresses key challenges in DLP printing, such as regions with large overhangs and staircase artifacts, while preserving its intrinsic advantages of high resolution and fast printing speeds. We formulate the slicing problem as an optimization task, in which parametric curves are computed to define both the slicing layers and the model partitioning through their tangent planes. These curves inherently define motion trajectories for the build platform and can be optimized to meet critical manufacturing objectives, including collision-free motion and floating-free deposition. We validate our method through physical experiments on a robotic multi-axis DLP printing setup, demonstrating that the optimized curves can robustly guide smooth, high-quality fabrication of complex geometries.
