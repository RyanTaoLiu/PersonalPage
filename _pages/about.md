<div class="homepage-intro">
  <p class="lead">I am <strong>Tao Liu</strong>, a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/">University of Manchester</a>, supervised by Professor Charlie C.L. Wang, working in the field of <strong>neural-based design and manufacturing optimization</strong>. My research focuses on <span class="highlight-text">computational geometry, additive manufacturing, and robotics</span>.</p>
</div>

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **multi-axis 3D printing, topology optimization, and computational design frameworks** for advanced additive manufacturing. I am particularly interested in:

- **Neural implicit representations** for geometric modeling
- **Computational geometry** and surface reconstruction
- **Fiber-reinforced composites** and material optimization

## Education

Before my Ph.D., I received my **B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computational Mathematics**, supervised by Professor Shengjun LIU from [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/), ChangSha, China.

## Publications & Service

I have published in some journals and conferences such as **ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)**, **IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering**, and **Composites Part B**. Beyond research, I also serve as a teaching assistant for programming, modelling, and additive manufacturing courses at Manchester.

I serve as a reviewer for journals and conferences, including:
- *ACM SIGGRAPH** and *SIGGRAPH Asia*
- *ACM Symposium on Computational Fabrication (SCF)*
- *Additive Manufacturing Process (AMP)*
- *Computer Aided Design (CAD)*
- *Computer Aided Geometry Design (CAGD)*
- *Eurographics (EG)*
- *Graphical Models (GMod)*
