In this paper, we present a concurrent and scalable trajectory optimization method to improve the quality of robot-assisted manufacturing. Our method simultaneously optimizes tool orientations, kinematic redundancy, and waypoint timing on input toolpaths with large numbers of waypoints to improve kinematic smoothness while incorporating manufacturing constraints. Differently, existing methods always determine them in a decoupled manner. To deal with the large number of waypoints on a toolpath, we propose a decomposition-based numerical scheme to optimize the trajectory in an out-of-core manner, which can also run in parallel to improve the efficiency. Simulations and physical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of our method in examples of robot-assisted additive manufacturing.
