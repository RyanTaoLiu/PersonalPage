I am **Tao Liu**, a Ph.D. student at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), supervised by Professor Charlie C.L. Wang, 
working in the field of **neural-based design and manufacturing optimization**.  
My research focuses on **multi-axis 3D printing, topology optimization, and computational design frameworks** 
for advanced additive manufacturing. I am particularly interested in **neural implicit representations, 
computational geometry, and fiber-reinforced composites**.

Before my Ph.D., I received my **B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computational Mathematics**, supervised by Professor Shengjun LIU from 
[Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/), ChangSha, China.

I have published in journals and conferences such as *ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)*, 
*IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering*, and *Composites Part B*.  
Beyond research, I also serve as a teaching assistant for programming, modelling, 
and additive manufacturing courses at Manchester. 

I also serve as a reviewer for journals and conferences, 
including **ACM SIGGRAPH**, **SIGGRAPH Asia**, **Eurographics (EG)**, 
the **ACM Symposium on Computational Fabrication (SCF)**, **Graphical Models (GMod)**, **Additive Manufacturing Process (AMP)** and so on.
